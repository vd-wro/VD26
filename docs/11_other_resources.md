## 11.2 3D Models

All custom mechanical parts designed for VizDrive are available as STL files. These models can be used for replication, modification, or further study of the robot's physical structure.

* **Chassis:** The main structural frame of the robot.
  * [View 3D Model (STL)](./../models/chassis/chassis.stl)
* **Front Wheel Rims:** Custom-designed rims for the front wheels.
  * [View 3D Model (STL)](./../models/wheels/wheels.stl)
* **Front Wheel Hubs with Screws:** Hubs connecting to the steering rod, including screw designs.
  * [View 3D Model (STL)](./../models/wheels/wheel_hub.stl)
* **Encoder Wheel and Rear Wheel:** Precision-designed wheel with encoder markings and standard rear wheel.
  * [View 3D Model (STL)](./../models/encoder_wheel/)
* **Steering Rods and Camera Support:** Components for steering rods and the PixyCam mount.

## 11.3 MPU and Ultrasonic Calibration Data Visualization

* **Accumulated Error vs. Number of Samples Graph:** This chart illustrates the empirical data collected during MPU calibration, demonstrating the reduction in accumulated error as the number of samples increases, guiding the selection of optimal calibration parameters.
