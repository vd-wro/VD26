Welcome to the project repository for the **Panamanian 🇵🇦 Team VizDrive** for the **World Robot Olympiad (WRO)** 2025!
Here you will find all the documentation, source code, images, and models related to our autonomous robot.

## Project Summary

VizDrive is an autonomous robot designed to navigate a closed-loop circuit, maintaining a stable trajectory with gyroscopic correction. It uses artificial vision, in conjunction with ultrasonic and color sensors, to detect walls and avoid obstacles.

We are participating in the **Future Engineers Category** to develop our skills and demonstrate the capabilities of young Panamanians in a competitive field like robotics.

During the creation of our robot, we tried to push the **fundamentals of robotics** to the highest we could. As you go through this GitHub repository, you may notice that we worked with very basic sensors (the kind typically found in standard Arduino kits), and that we strived to optimize them to the best of our capacities. This is because we aimed to make our build accessible for everyone, and show that even with the simplest components, it is possible to create truly functional robotic systems.

 > [!NOTE]
> Throughout the competition, we are constantly making modifications in the software and hardware of our robot. We try to update on all the changes we make, but if you notice any inconsistency between the pages of the documentation, please let us know!
