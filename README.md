Welcome to the project repository for the **Panamanian 🔴⚪🔵 Team VizDrive** for the **World Robot Olympiad (WRO)** 2026!
Here you will find all the documentation, source code, images, and models related to our autonomous robot.

## About VizDrive's Legacy

VizDrive started in 2025, and now keeps thriving with the same young Panamanians that started the project. For this updated 2026 repository, we have kept ViZio's previous versions for better understanding and comparison from our engineering process.

## Project Summary

VizDrive's core, ViZio, is an autonomous robot designed to navigate a closed-loop circuit, maintaining a stable trajectory with gyroscopic correction. It uses artificial vision, in conjunction with ultrasonic and color sensors, to detect walls and avoid obstacles.

We are participating in the **Future Engineers Category** to develop our skills and demonstrate the capabilities of young Panamanians in a competitive field like robotics.

During the creation of our robot, we tried to push the **fundamentals of robotics** to the highest we could. As you go through this GitHub repository, you may notice that we worked with very basic sensors (the kind typically found in standard Arduino kits), and that we strived to optimize them to the best of our capacities. This is because we aimed to make our build accessible for everyone, and show that even with the simplest components, it is possible to create truly functional robotic systems.

> [!NOTE]
> Throughout the competition, we are constantly making modifications in the software and hardware of our robot. We try to update on all the changes we make, but if you notice any inconsistency between the pages of the documentation, please let us know!

## Special Thanks

We are profoundly thankful to everyone who has supported us on our journey so far! We're incredibly grateful to our school administration for providing the resources and trust needed to pursue this challenge. To our teachers, thank you for your guidance and advice during our preparation; we especially appreciate your patience with our absences for robot practices (we promise to catch up on our assignments after the Olympiad 😅). A special shout-out to our friends who spent their free time supporting us, cheering us on, and helping us stay up to date. To our amazing parents, your assurance and belief in us have been the foundation of our efforts, allowing us to participate even though it meant missing many classes. And last but certainly not least, to our incredible coach, Professor Agustín Rogelio Orro Pérez. Even while mentoring five other teams, you still found time to guide us through it all. Your expertise, leadership, and dedication have been invaluable for us.

Thank you all!
